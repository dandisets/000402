description: 'The light microscopic images were acquired from a cubic millimeter volume
  that spanned portions of primary visual cortex and three higher visual cortical
  areas. The volume was imaged in vivo by two-photon random access mesoscope (2P-RAM)
  from postnatal days P75 to P81 in a male mouse expressing a genetically encoded
  calcium indicator in excitatory cells, while the mouse viewed natural movies and
  parametric stimuli. The calcium imaging data includes the single-cell responses
  of an estimated 75,000 pyramidal cells imaged over a volume of approximately 1200
  x 1100 x 500 μm3 (anteroposterior x mediolateral x radial depth). The center of
  the volume was placed at the junction of primary visual cortex (VISp) and three
  higher visual areas, lateromedial area (VISlm), rostrolateral area (VISrl) and anterolateral
  area (VISal). During imaging, the animal was head-restrained, and the stimulus was
  presented to the left visual field. Treadmill rotation (single axis) and video of
  the animal''s left eye were captured throughout the scan, yielding the locomotion
  velocity, eye movements, and pupil diameter data included here.


  The functional data were co-registered with electron microscopy (EM) data. The structural
  identifiers of the matched cells are added as plane segmentation columns extracted
  from the CAVE database. To access the latest revision see the notebook that is linked
  to this dandiset. The structural ids might not be present for all plane segmentations.'
